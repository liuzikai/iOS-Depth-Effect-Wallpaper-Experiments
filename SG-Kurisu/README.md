Steps from [the original image](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/99301428) to [a working version](Kurisu-Lock-Screen.jpg):
* Extend the top margin. In the original image, Kurisu is too close to the top and will overlap too much with the clock. I used the Clone Stamp tool to extend the sky and manually extended the solar board.
* The critical step: denoise the background
  * Select the foreground with Object Selection tool + Direct Selection tool + Magic Wand tool. Select inverse.
  * Denoise with max strength, about 50% color denoise.
  * Gaussian blur.
* Fine-tune the brightness/saturation/contrast of the foreground and the background.
